                            <p>If you're new to gym, the best place to start is in a beginner's class, even if you are strong and physically fit. 
                                It's also a great way to get introduced to basics and meditation.
                                 Even if you're in great shape, don't underestimate the value of starting with beginner's classesâ€”you'll be glad you did.</p>

                <p>All-levels classes can be a grab-bag of the styles teachers love to teach. Typically, you'll find multiple levels of instruction and modifications offered, and one student may not be doing the exact same thing as the next. When you're not sure of what class you're in the mood for on any given day, consider an all levels class as your default option.</p>
